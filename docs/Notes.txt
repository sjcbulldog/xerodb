My Open Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Are there material/machine combinations that are valid vs invalid?
   For now all combinations are valid 
2. How do we know if we need a drawing?
   Right now the mentor picks when doing the drawing check
3. When you copy a part to a new location in the tree, do you keep the student/mentor?

TODO

Parts view page - cannot edit but see all details

User's guide

Inventory

Ready To Order Report - showing quantities

Purchased Assemblies (optionally add vendor)

Check: an assembly done date cannot be before the done dates of its children

Generalize the concept of top level robots so there can be more than two
    - delete in viewrobot.js
    - order in DashboardService.ts

views
    - Assembly dependency view
