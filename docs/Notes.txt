My Open Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Are there material/machine combinations that are valid vs invalid?
   For now all combinations are valid 
2. How do we know if we need a drawing?
   Right now the mentor picks when doing the drawing check
3. When you copy a part to a new location in the tree, do you keep the student/mentor?
